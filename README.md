# Sentry-Cogs

## DISCLAIMER
this repository was used for the now defunct [Red-Discordbot Version 2](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/tree/develop) and contains a bunch of code hastily slaped together.
In 2017 I decided no more and discontinued my cogs to explore other things, taking down my repositories with me to make sure no one would fall victim to my shotty code.
As of March 2019 [Sentry-Cogs](https://github.com/Jan200101/Sentry-Cogs) and [Explosive-Cogs](https://github.com/Jan200101/Explosive-Cogs) are both back on github with most of their original git history preserved

Here lie Sentry's old cogs made back when he was still learning Python.
At the time of writing this [11.07.2017] all cogs still work but have been discontinued in favor of [Explosive-Cogs](https://github.com/Jan200101/Explosive-Cogs) a new repo made by Sentry to make it work more professional then before

Feel free to fork this Repo and make changes to it or remake certain cogs in this repository
