# Sentry-Cogs
Here lie Sentry's old cogs made back when he was still learning Python.
At the time of writing this [11.07.2017] all cogs still work but have been discontinued in favor of [Explosive-Cogs](https://github.com/Jan200101/Explosive-Cogs) a new repo made by Sentry to make it work more professional then before

Feel free to fork this Repo and make changes to it or remake certain cogs in this repository
